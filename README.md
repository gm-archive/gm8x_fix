gm8x_fix is a patcher that fixes certain issues in games made with
GameMaker 8.x.

# How do I use it?
Drag the executable file for your game onto gm8x_fix.exe. Or, if you're a
commandline nerd, you can run it with:
```bash
gm8x_fix [-s] FILE
```
The -s option removes commandline output. It will still exit with code 1 on
failure though, so check for that if you're automating.

For building, you can just build the C file with your favourite compiler, it
doesn't have any dependencies.

# The issues this fixes, and how it fixes them
Early versions of GameMaker have a *terrible* implementation of joystick
support, which can cause games to slow down if joysticks are installed but not
plugged in. This slowdown exists on games that don't use the joystick
functions, but is much worse on games that do. This occurs because every frame,
it polls the first two joysticks even if they aren't connected, and polling
joysticks that aren't connected causes a massive search through the registry,
which takes up a lot of time.<br/>
This patch replaces literally every call to the joystick API with some code
that pretends there are no joysticks connected. Basically, it completely
disables joystick support.

Some games also run into issues on some newer computers where the game crashes
on startup with the message "Unexpected error occured when running the game."<br/>
This can, on some games, be fixed by enabling the flag in the header that tells
the OS the program can understand addresses bigger than 2GB. Shoutouts to
[these guys](https://iwannacommunity.com/forum/index.php@topic=2308.msg16505.html)
for finding that.

GameMaker games use DirectPlay for networking, but loading the DirectPlay DLL
on newer versions of Windows brings up a prompt because DirectPlay is
deprecated. In fact, on newer versions of Windows, it just doesn't work at all.<br/>
The patch replaces the attempt to load DirectPlay with an attempt to load
literally nothing. This somehow doesn't break anything unless you're using the
networking functions.

# So what's the catch?
If the game used the builtin joystick functions, it will no longer work with
joysticks if you apply the joystick patch. Some games use an external library
like [joydll](http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=495788)
for joystick support. Those will work fine.

The DirectPlay patch will break networking. Any calls to the networking
functions will probably trigger an access violation. If this causes problems
outside of multiplayer modes in any games, open an issue and I'll make a less
janky solution.
